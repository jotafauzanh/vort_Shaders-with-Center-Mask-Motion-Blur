# vort_Shaders - for use with ReShade

TL;DR; \
Effects in HDR: Tonemapping, Bloom, Sharpening, Far Blur, .cube LUTs, Color Palette Generation, Color Grading \
Effects in LDR: Per-object Motion Blur

I strongly recommend that you use [REST addon v1.2.1](https://github.com/4lex4nder/ReshadeEffectShaderToggler/releases/tag/v1.2.1) \
Otherwise the Bloom and the Motion Blur will affect the UI of the game.
